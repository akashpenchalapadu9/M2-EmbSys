## High level Requirements
- H01 User should select the type of coffee like filter coffee or normal coffee.
- H02 User should make sure power is turned ON.
- H03 User should make sure water is filled before starting.
- H04 User should make sure coffee powder and Sugar are placed in particular space given.
- H05 User make sure that once cup filled , power is turned off.

## Low level Requirements
- L01 User should place cup below the nob.
- L02 Once cup is filled it should notify using Buzzer.

## Components
## Power supply
LCD, IR operate on 5volt DC supplyto drive the AC motor and heatewr we require 230volts,50Hz supply.
## LCD Display
It is used to know which option we have selected.
## Microcontroller
Microcontroller is used to control the process of washing machine cycle to drive the external output devices such as water inlet value, water drain value etc.
## IR sensor
A proximity sensor is used to detect any object without any contact.
## EPROM 
An EPROM is type of memory chip that retains its power supply is switched off. Each storage location of EPROM consist of single field effect transistor each field effect transistor consist of channel in the semiconductor body of device. To retrive data from the EPROM the address represented by the values at the adress pins of the EPROM is decoded and used to connect one word of the storage to the output buffer amplifier. The EPROM is used to store the data regarding the consumption of coffee by each employee

# Washing Machine 



## High level Requirements
- H01 Washing machine should provide one option to wash their laundry quickly.
- H02 User should make sure that higher the RPM, the faster it rotates to remove water from cloths.
- H03 User should make sure that water supply is given before starting.
- H04 User make sure that wheather detergent and other things are placed in given space.

## Low level Requirements
- L01 User should place their cloths into the washing machine.
- L02 Once after complition washing cloths it should notify using buzzer.
## Components
## Power Supply
In the power supply, step doen transformer is used to reduce the nececcery voltage for the control unit and other components.
## Microcontroller
Microcontroller is used to cotrol the process of washing cycle and to drive the external output devices such as water inlet value, water drain value.
## Driver Circuit 
The driver circuit gives signal to power electronics devices such as relays, triacs.
## Water level sensor 
It detects the water level in the tub.
## Motor control 
The motor can be used to agitate the drum by switching the field winding with respect to the armature.
