# Components
- ATMEGA8 : An ATMega Microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller with Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) based Harvard Architecture.

- Power supply : A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage.

- Servo motor (sg90):Servo motors (or servos) are self-contained electric devices that rotate or push parts of a machine with great precision.

- BUZZER : A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric(piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

- RESISTOR (10KΩ ,220Ω), Button.
