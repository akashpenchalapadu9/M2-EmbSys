# FIRE DETECTION ALARM SYSTEM

## Abstract
The primary purpose of fire detection alarm system is to provide an early warning of fire so that people can be evacuvated and immediate action can be taken to stop or eliminate of the fire effect as soon of possible. Alarm can be triggered by using detectors.

# Components
- Arduino UNO - Arduino UNO is a low-cost, flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects.

- LED - (light-emitting diode) a semiconductor diode that emits light when conducting current and is used in electronic displays, indoor and outdoor lighting.

- FLAME SENSOR - Flame sensor module has a photodiode to detect the light and an op-amp to control the sensitivity. It is used to detect fire and provide a HIGH signal upon the detection. Arduino reads the signal and provides alert by turning on the buzzer and LED.

- BUZZER - A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric(piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

- RESISTOR - A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
