# Reqirements
## High Level Requirement

| ID | Description |  
| ----- | ----- | 
| HLR01 | Empty Dustbin should be there before use |
| HLR02 | As the person move towards the dustbin Ultrasonic sensor should be able to sense for opening the door|
| HLR03 | The IR sensor should be able to detect when Dustbin is full| 
| HLR04 | Ultrasonic Sensor provide signals to the Servo motor based on that it should work |
 
## Low Level Requirement

| ID | Description |  
| ----- | ----- |
| LLR01 |When the person moves towards the dustbin then the Ultrasonic sensor senses it and then provide signals to  servomotor,then it will should rotate 90 degrees to open the top of Dustbin |
| LLR02 |When the ultrasonic detects user is moving away from the Dustbin servomotor should rotate 90 degrees(opposite direction) to close the top of Dustbin| 
| LLR03 | IR sensor detects Dustbin is full by turning ON LED |
| LLR04 | When the Dustbin is empty the LED should turn OFF |
