# FIRE DETECTION ALARM SYSTEM

## Abstract
The primary purpose of fire detection alarm system is to provide an early warning of fire so that people can be evacuvated and immediate action can be taken to stop or eliminate of the fire effect as soon of possible. Alarm can be triggered by using detectors.

# Components
- ATMEGA8 : An ATMega Microcontroller is an 8-bit microcontroller with Reduced Instruction Set (RISC) based Harvard Architecture.

- Power supply : A power supply is an electrical device that supplies electric power to an electrical load. The main purpose of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage.

- Servo motor (sg90):Servo motors (or servos) are self-contained electric devices that rotate or push parts of a machine with great precision.

- BUZZER : A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric(piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.

- RESISTOR (10KΩ ,220Ω), Button.

# SWOT Analysis


# 4W's and 1H

## Who
- In house,Public places like movie theaters etc.

## What
- TO provide buzzer(audio singnals) when fire detects.

## When
- When some fire accidents happens in public or any places it will be more helfull.

## Where
- To protect our surrounding from fire accidents.

## How
By creating this model helps users that is when fire accidents happens the fire sensor send the signals , then buzzer start to seiren autometically.
